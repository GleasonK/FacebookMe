#FacebookMe

FacebookMe is a python Facebook crawler that finds other users who have your same name. It then writes these users to an organized HTML file so you can see fellow users who share your name.

##To Use:
1. Clone the repository

2. Run the __fb_me.py__ file in IDLE or terminal with the following command

        python fb_me.py

3. You will be prompted to enter your name

4. The program will then attempt to crawl 1000 pages of users with your name

5. Upon completion an HTML file wll be written in the local folder

6. Click on this file and it will open in your browser showing your fellow FB users.
